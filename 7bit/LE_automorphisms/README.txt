For each class of canonical LE-automorphisms, quad_apn.c performs a search for quadratic APN functions admitting that particular LE-automorphism. For lots of classes, this search terminates in short time (e.g., a few seconds up to minutes). However, for some classes, the deterministic search is infeasible. The program quad_apn_rand.c performs a randomized search for quadratic APN functions admitting that particular LE-automorphism.

We found quadratic APN functions in Classes 1, 7, 16, and 19.

Note that Classes 3, 32, 33, 41, 42, 44, 49, 50, 53, 57-86, and all Classes >= 93 cannot yield APN functions, so they are not included in our search.
