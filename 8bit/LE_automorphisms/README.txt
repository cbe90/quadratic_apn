For each class of canonical LE-automorphisms, quad_apn.c performs a search for quadratic APN functions admitting that particular LE-automorphism. For lots of classes, this search terminates in short time (e.g., a few seconds up to minutes). However, for some classes, the search is infeasible. The program quad_apn_rand.c performs a randomized search for quadratic APN functions admitting that particular LE-automorphism.

We found quadratic APN functions in Classes 1, 2, 21, 31, 38, 51, 55, 56, and 113.

Note that Classes 23, 35-37, 45, 46, 50, 57-62, 66, 67, 71, 76-108, and all Classes >= 117 cannot yield APN functions, so they are not included in our search.
